SmallPy Language Specification
------------------------------

Motivation:

- Establish a "Numeric Recipies in C" subset of Python. Just
  unambiguously make numeric loops fast, do this well because it
  generates revenue for Continuum. Then keep the "clever path" as
  an ongoing project into how to type larger sets of Python.

- Allow perfect reasoning about performance by demarcating a
  subset of Python that either lowers into LLVM or fails to
  compile.
  
- If code compiles it is guaranteed to be faster than the
  equivalent CPython.

- Improve the overall user experience of error reporting so that
  the end-user knows how to change their code to match the
  subset.

- Explicit is better than implicit. If the end user wants to go
  through the Object Layer make them say so.

Types
-----

- int
- float
- bool
- string
- unicode
- complex
- list
- tuple
- NoneType
- FunctionType

Unsupported Types:

- object
- dict
- set
- long
- frozenset
- buffer
- bytearray
- bytes
- basestring
- memoryview

Values
------

Tuple unpacking is not supported.

Assignment to tuples is syntactic sugar for multiple assignment
only when r-values are literals.

Supported:

```
a, b = 1, True
```

Not Supported:

```
a, b = f()
```

Control Flow
------------

Supported:

- If
- If/Else
- If/ElseIf/Else
- For
- While

Not Supported:

- Generators
- Exceptions
- Try
- Try/Finally
- Try/Except
- Try/Except/Finally
- While/Else
- For/Else

Data Model
----------

- Lists are stricly homogeneus containers of data. The
  storage is compiler specific.
- Tuples are heteroegneous immutable types. The storage is
  compiler specific.
- Strings are variable immutable arrays of ascii characters. The
  storage is compiler specific.
- Unicode strings are immutable arrays of UTF-8 characters. The
  storage is compiler specific.

The ``list`` constructor polymorphically lifts elements into
singleton containers.

```
list :: a -> [a]
```

Introspection
-------------

Runtime introspection with ``type``, ``isinstance``,
``issubclass``, ``id``, ``globals``, ``locals``, ``dir``,
``callable``, ``getattr``, ``hash``, ``hasattr``, ``super``,
``vars`` is not supported.

The ``intern`` function is not supported.

Length
------

The implementation of the ``len`` function is polymorphic and
container specific.

```python
len :: [a] -> int
```

Destruction
-----------

Variable and element destruction is not supported. The ``del``
operator is not part of the syntax and ``delattr` is not
supported.

Metaprogramming
---------------

``compile``, ``eval`` and ``exec``, ``execfile`` are not supported

Pass
----

Pass is a syntactic construct that translates into a compiler
specific noop.

System IO
---------

``file``, ``open`` and ``quit``, ``raw_input``, ``reload``,
``help`` and ``input`` are not supported.

``print`` is optionally supported. The implementation is specific
to the compiler. For compilers that do not choose to implement
print it should translate to noop.

The ``repr`` function is not supported.

Formatting
----------

Printf style formatting is not supported. The ``Mod`` operator
exclusively maps to numeric modulus.

Iterators
---------

Generators are not supported.

Range iterators are syntactic sugar for looping constructs. Custom
iterators are not supported. The ``iter`` and ``next`` functions
are not supported.

```
for i in xrange(start, stop, step)
    foo()
```

Is lowered into some equivalent low-level looping construct that
roughly corresponds to the following C code:

```
for (i = start; i < stop; i += step) {
    foo();
}
```

The value of ``i`` after the loop block follows the Python
semantics and is set to the last value in the iterator instead of
the C semantics.

``xrange`` and `range`` are lowered into the same constructs.

``enumerate`` is not supported

Comparison operator chaining is supported and is desugared into
boolean conjunctions of the comparison operators.

```
(x > y > z)
```

```
(x > y) and (y > z)
```

Smallpy explictly does not support the following operators.

- Is
- IsNot
- In
- NotIn

Division
--------

Division follows the Python semantics for distinction between
``floordiv`` and ``truediv`` but operates over unboxed types
with no error checking.
